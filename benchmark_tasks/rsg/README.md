# RussianSuperGLUE

This folder conttains two datasets from [Russian SuperGLUE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15925) benchmark: RWSD, PARus, and RCB.

## RWSD

A Russian Winograd Schema Dataset (RWSD) is a task in which each example contains
a sentence with two selected phrases. The task is to define whether they are used
in the same sense or not. The schema takes its name from a well-known example by
Terry Winograd. 

## PARus

The choice of Plausible Alternatives for the Russian language (PARus) evaluation provides researchers with a tool for assessing progress in open-domain commonsense causal reasoning. Each question in PARus is composed of a premise and two alternatives, where the task is to select the alternative that more plausibly has a causal relation with the premise. 

## RCB

The Russian Commitment Bank (RCB) is a corpus of naturally occurring discourse whose final
sentence contains a clause-embedding predicate under an entailment canceling operator
(question, modal, negation, antecedent of conditional).
