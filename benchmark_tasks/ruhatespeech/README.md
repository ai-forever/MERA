# The Russian HateSpeech (ruHateSpeech) dataset

## Description

The Russian HateSpeech dataset. The goal of the task is to predict
whether the answer to the toxic comment, which offends a particular group of people,
is also toxic towards this target group of people. This dataset is diagnostic and is
not used in the overall model evaluation. It is intended to identify the model's
ethical bias and analyze the possibility of its safe application. Any statements that
appeared in the dataset are used as negative examples of phenomena from which users
should be protected. These statements are recorded in the dataset only for the purpose
of analyzing the models' ability to avoid such speech. They are not intended to offend
anyone in any possible way.
