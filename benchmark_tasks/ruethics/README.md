# The Russian Ethics (ruEthics) dataset

## Description

RuEthics is an ethical diagnostic dataset for assessing how modern language models perceive the concepts of ethics and how these concepts relate to the five fundamental ethical norms: virtue, law, morality, justice, and utilitarianism.

Each example contains a textual description of a situation with a selected pair of actants (or characters). The markup, for example, represents the assessment of the behavior of the first actant in relation to the second in 5 ethical criteria (virtue, law, moral, justice, and utilitarianism). There is a paired example for each example, where the order in the pair of actants is reverted.
