# **ruMMLU**

## Task Description

**Russian Massive Multitask Language Understanding (ruMMLU)** is a dataset designed to measure model professional knowledge acquired during pretraining in various fields . The task covers 57 subjects (subdomains) across different topics (domains): HUMANITIES; SOCIAL SCIENCE; SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM); OTHER. The dataset was created based on the English MMLU dataset proposed in [1] and follows its methodology in the instruction formal. Each example contains a question from one of the categories with four possible answers, only one of which is correct.

**Warning:** to avoid data leakage for ruMMLU, we created the NEW closed test set that follows the original MMLU design. Thus, **results on the MMLU and ruMMLU datasets cannot be directly compared with each other.**

**Warning:** additional open data is the public test set of the original MMLU dataset. Do not use it in train purposes!

**Keywords**: logic, world knowledge, factual, expert knowledge

### Motivation

This set is a continuation of the idea GLUE [2] and SuperGLUE [3] benchmarks, which focus on generalized assessment of tasks for understanding the language (NLU). Unlike sets like ruWorldTree and ruOpenBookQA (where questions are similar to MMLU format), which cover tests of the school curriculum and elementary knowledge, ruMMLU is designed to test professional knowledge in various fields.

## Dataset Description

### Data Fields

- `instruction` is a string containing instructions for the task and information about the requirements for the model output format;
- `inputs` is a dictionary that contains the following information:
    - `text` is the test question;
    - `option_a` is the option A;
    - `option_b` is the option B;
    - `option_c` is the option C;
    - `option_d` is the option D;
    - `subject` is the topic of the question (generalization of a group of subdomains by meaning);
- `outputs` is the result: can be one of the following string variables: "A", "B", "C", "D";
- `meta` is a dictionary containing meta information:
    - `id` is an integer indicating the index of the example;
    - `domain` is question subdomain.

### Data Instances

### Data Splits

The public test set contains `10033` examples. The closed test set `961` hand-written examples.

### Prompts

For this task 5 prompts of varying difficulty were created. Example:

### Dataset Creation

The open set is based on the [the original MMLU dataset](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) and translated to the Russian language using the following pipeline: 1)  the public test was translated into Russian using automatic translation; 2) the translations were verified on the Yandex.Toloka platform; 3) the data that did not pass verification was manually validated and Russified. The current version of the open public set is not final, and the dataset set will be updated in the future.

For the closed test set, the set was assembled manually according to the original format with domains as close as possible to the original set. The set is adapted for the Russian language and culture. The distribution of tasks across individual specific domains corresponds to the original set and is equal to an average of 150 examples.

## Evaluation

### Metrics

The dataset is evaluated using Accuracy and, following the original methodology, is evaluated in the few-shot format with five shots.

### Human benchmark

According to the original article, for English test human-level accuracy varies:
"Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk obtain 34.5% accuracy on English test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For example, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical Licensing Examinations, and these questions make up our ‚ÄúProfessional Medicine‚Äù task. If we take the 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an educated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is approximately 89.8%.".

Accuracy of the annotation on the test set is `84.4%`.

## Limitations

The questions relate to human knowledge relevant on January 1, 2020, for the train part and on October 31, 2023, for the test part.
